# Smart-Home
When you bring your home and technology together, it can be referred to as  “Smart Home.” For instance, lights, switches, audio speakers, thermostats,  security cameras are connected to a common system and can control the  entire home by itself. With a smart home, you can explore the world of high-tech functionality and  luxury that was not necessarily possible in the past.
